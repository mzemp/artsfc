AUTHORS

Douglas Rudd <drudd@uchicago.edu> (original code)
Marcel Zemp <marcelzemp@gmail.com> (adaption into a library)


OFFICIAL SOURCE

GitHub: https://github.com/mzemp/artsfc


DEPENDENCIES

iof library (https://github.com/mzemp/iof)


COMPILATION & INSTALLATION

First, make sure you have installed the iof library. The Makefile assumes that you have installed that in a local library path (e.g. ~/libraries/ under your home directory) and the following environment variable is set (e.g. in your .bashrc file):

export LOCAL_LIB_PATH=~/libraries

Then clone or download the code from GitHub. In order to compile the code just type make in the artsfc code directory:

$> make

This will generate a static library file called libartsfc.a. Other code can then be linked against this library.

In order to clean up the code type:

$> make clean

Assuming that the artsfc code directory is located within a local library directory (e.g. ~/libraries/ under your home directory) you can type:

$> make install

in the code directory. This will then generate symbolic links to the artsfc.h and libartsfc.a in the parallel directories ~/libraries/include/ and ~/libraries/lib/, respectively.
